# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
#
# Cabinet (j0nathontayl0r/cabinet, fork of hilash/cabinet) — multi-stage image.
#
# This file is a ready-to-copy artifact maintained in the `portainer` repo
# (ai-agents-wd/cabinet/Dockerfile). To build:
#   1. Copy this file into the root of a clone of `j0nathontayl0r/cabinet`
#      (the repo's existing .dockerignore already excludes node_modules,
#      .next, .git, data, and most *.md files from the build context).
#   2. From that repo's root:
#        docker build -t ghcr.io/j0nathontayl0r/cabinet:0.4.6 .
#
# Runtime model:
#   - The image's default CMD starts BOTH the Next.js app (`npm run
#     start:next`) and the daemon (`npm run start:daemon`) as a single
#     container process (useful for local/manual `docker run`).
#   - In Kubernetes, the Deployment runs TWO containers from this same
#     image, each overriding `command:` to run only one of the two
#     processes (`["npm","run","start:next"]` / `["npm","run","start:daemon"]`).
#     ENTRYPOINT is intentionally left as the default shell form so that
#     `command:` overrides replace CMD cleanly without any wrapper logic
#     getting in the way.

# Install dependencies first for better layer caching.

# package.json declares a `postinstall` hook (`node scripts/postinstall.mjs`)
# that npm runs automatically during `npm ci`, so that script must exist in
# the image before the install or `npm ci` fails with MODULE_NOT_FOUND. It is
# self-contained (only Node builtins + better-sqlite3, no project imports) and
# on Linux rebuilds better-sqlite3 from source when the prebuilt binding's
# NODE_MODULE_VERSION doesn't match this runtime. Copy just that one script
# (not the whole source tree) so the dependency layer still caches across
# source-only changes.

# Default CMD: run both the Next.js app and the daemon as one container

# this CMD cleanly for the per-process containers.
# Uses bash for `wait -n` (wait for the first job to exit). Debian/bookworm
